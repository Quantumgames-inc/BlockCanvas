## what is flowcanvas? ##
flowcanvas is a visual scripting editor for playcanvas.com. it is made with javascript/node.js.
## how will i be able to use it? ##
hopefully, it will be implemented into the official versions of playcanvas.com. if not, then i don't know.

not for a while. we need to work hard to make this as good as it can be. we will keep you up to date below!

## roadmap ##
| things to do | Developed? | Added to Playcanvas? | developing? |
| --- | --- | ---| --- |
| editor | no | no | yes |
| nodes | no | no | no |
| configure nodes to work with playcanvas | no| no| no|
## what we need to do ##
- create a server to host the editor
- create a REST API to communicate the editor to the engine
- make a library for playcanvas so when you want to create a script, there will be an option to use the node editor
- configure all the nodes
- make the communication script sense what nodes were used and what nodes connect to other nodes, then print that information as playcanvas javascript code in the script on playcanvas
