## what is flowcanvas? ##
flowcanvas is a visual scripting editor for playcanvas.com. it is made with javascript/node.js.
## how will i be able to use it? ##
hopefully, it will be implemented into the official versions of playcanvas.com. if not, then i don't know.
## when will it be available? ##
not for a while. we need to work hard to make this as good as it can be. we will keep you up to date below! 
## development update-start of development! ##
we have started development! 
--
| version updates | what's new | date published |
| --- | --- | --- |
| development 0.0.1 | started development! | N/A |
| alpha 1.0.0 | editor alpha release | march 17th |
| alpha 1.2.0 | converter dev release | march 18th |

money would be nice, but i am doing this for fun. what you could do, is play our game, Left 2 Die! we made it on playcanvas.com.
## roadmap ##
| things to do | Developed? | Added to Playcanvas? | developing? |
| --- | --- | ---| --- |
| editor | no | no | yes |
| nodes | no | no | yes |
| create download button to download script for playcanvas based off node data | no| no| yes|
| converter | no | no | yes
## what we need to do ##
- create a server to host the editor
- create a function to get what nodes and the data of the nodes being used, then output it to a json file or other data file
- make a converter script that reads the data file, then outputs it as javascript playcanvas code that you can then press a button to download
- configure all the nodes
