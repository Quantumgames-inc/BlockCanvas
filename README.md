## what is flowcanvas? ##
flowcanvas is a visual scripting editor for playcanvas.com. it is made with javascript/node.js.
## how will i be able to use it? ##
hopefully, it will be implemented into the official versions of playcanvas.com. if not, then i don't know.
## when will it be available? ##
not for a while. we need to work hard to make this as good as it can be. we will keep you up to date below!

## roadmap ##
| things to do | Developed? | Added to Playcanvas? | developing? |
| --- | --- | ---| --- |
| editor | no | no | yes |
| nodes | no | no | no |
| create download button to download script for playcanvas based off node data | no| no| no|
## what we need to do ##
- create a server to host the editor
- create a function to get what nodes and the data of the nodes being used, then output it to a json file or other data file
- make a converter script that reads the data file, then outputs it as javascript playcanvas code that you can then press a button to download
- configure all the nodes
